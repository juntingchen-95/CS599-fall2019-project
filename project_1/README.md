Hastie, et al. Elements of Statistical Learning, Figure 13.4

### Steps to reproduce

Necessary software: Python 3, R, RStudio

1. Download the project folder

2. In the command line, change the root in the project folder, type "python main.py". Then, it will generate the file "result.csv"

3. In RStudio, open the file "generate_figure.R", select all and run the code, then it will generate the figure file "result_figure.pdf". Before running the code, you need to make sure that ggplot2 package is installed
